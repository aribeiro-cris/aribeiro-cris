### Hi there 👋

### I'm Andreia, a self-taught developer on a journey from recruitment to software development, driven by a passion for problem-solving and technology.

🧠 I graduated in Psychology from the University of Minho and I have 4 years of experience working in recruitment. I'm a people person and thrive the most working in a fast-paced and multicultural environment. As a recruiter, I have gained experience in project management, mentoring team members, and implementing efficient processes. My time in recruitment exposed me to diverse tech roles, sparking my curiosity about programming and technology.

🖥️ Currently, I'm developing my skills through an intensive full-stack Bootcamp with Code for All_, Academia de Código, specializing in Java Web Applications.

🌱 My tech stack includes Java, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, SQL, Spring Framework, Spring MVC, JUnit, Mockito, Maven, and Git. Currently, I'm also expanding my knowledge of Scrum Agile methodology, Design Patterns, and SOLID Principles. I'm constantly learning and exploring new technologies to broaden my expertise.
