### Hi, it's me fellow developer 👋

### I'm Andreia, a self-taught full-stack developer doing a career transition from recruitment to software development.

🧠 I graduated in Psychology from the University of Minho and have 4 years of experience in recruitment. I'm a people person and thrive in a supportive and multicultural environment. As a recruiter, I have gained experience in project management, mentoring team members, and implementing efficient processes. My time in recruitment exposed me to diverse tech roles, sparking my curiosity about programming and technology.

🖥️ I completed an intensive full-stack Bootcamp with Code for All_, specializing in Java Web Applications.

🌱 My tech stack includes Java, JavaScript, React, Node.js, CSS, HTML, SQL, Spring Framework, Spring MVC, JUnit, Jest, Tailwind CSS, and Git. Currently, I'm also expanding my knowledge of Scrum Agile methodology, Design Patterns, and SOLID Principles. I'm constantly learning and exploring new technologies to broaden my expertise.
